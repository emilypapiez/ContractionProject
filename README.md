First use the PegMeasurement.m code to find the radius of the agarose pegs as well as the radius of center circle whose edges should touch the inner edges of the pegs.
Then use Contraction_PhaseInverting.m code to measure the tissue area contraction overtime in microtissues imaged with a phase inverting microscope or use the Contraction_OlympusConfocal.m code for microtissues imaged with an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope.
In order for either contraction code to work, you need to already know the radius of your agarose pegs and center circle in your images (in pixels) which you can measure with the PegMeasurement.m code.
